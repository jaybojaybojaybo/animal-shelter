      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>The force is strong with this one! Hello everyone! My name Kenobi and I am a playful, energetic 1 year old shepherd mix weighing in around 50lbs. I am still a young, active guy that is just bouncy and fun! With all this energy, I would be a great hiking adventure dog, as we see all the wonders of the galaxy. Though I have the force, I am still learning how to use and will need someone willing to show me the basics, as PUPPY CLASSES ARE MANDATORY FOR MY ADOPTION! Because of my puppy bounces and jumps, I would need to be in home without kids or cats, and with a lot of space or a yard to run around in! I do enjoy playing jedi games with my puppy pals and would be ok with another confident pup that wants to play all the time like I do! I am just eagerly awaiting to start my next adventure. Will there be light sabers? Ewoks? Droids? I don’t know, but let’s find out! I have been searching across all the planets & moons just to find you! Fill out an application today, so we can meet! I come to you neutered, vaccinated, and micro-chipped with an adoption fee of $300.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Look at those adorable bat ears! Hi everyone! My name is Colby Jack and I am an adorable 11lb terrier mix here to steal your heart. This city life is all so new to me, so I can be a little shy at first. But don’t let that fool you! Because once we have some time to hang out, I am a super energetic guy eager to bond. I just love to play fetch with my favorite squeaker toys, as I zoom around the play yard from left to right until I finally catch that toy! Because I am little sensitive to city life, I would prefer to be in a quiet low key neighborhood, as the bustle of apartment city life is overwhelming to me. I am quite the ladies man and love playing with my female puppy pals. So a lady in the house would be alright by me! I need to be in a cat free home with kids over 10. With a little patience and a few treats, I am a lovable goofball ready to play! Care to join me? Fill out an application today, so we can meet! I come to you neutered, vaccinated, and micro-chipped with an adoption fee of $300.</p>
